      // my journey to coding //
      <br />
      I am a Fullstack Web Developer with a background in Japanese studies,
      content management, and web administration. While living in Japan I
      discovered my love for coding, submerged myself into this new world, and
      eventually even quit my job to focus on my studies and find a job as a
      developer (which I conquered successfully). After working as a developer
      for a while, I moved back to Berlin to be closer to my family during this
      global pandemic and to join Ironhack, a 9-week fullstack web development
      course. At Ironhack I was able to further deepen my knowledge in web
      development and gather first-hand experience in building modern
      single-page web applications utilising the power of MongoDB, Express,
      React, and Node.js in an agile work environment.

      // programming is caring //
      <br />
      My personal motto is “programming is caring” and I stand for empathy,
      reliability, and determination. In my work as a developer I am passionate
      about bringing user-friendly interfaces to life and creating products that
      help to build a more inclusive world - website by website.

      // open to work & connect //
      <br />
      I am currently looking to join a creative and dynamic team to create
      amazing products and further grow as a developer. I am based in Berlin but
      open to remote positions. I’m always happy to connect with fellow people
      in IT as well!
